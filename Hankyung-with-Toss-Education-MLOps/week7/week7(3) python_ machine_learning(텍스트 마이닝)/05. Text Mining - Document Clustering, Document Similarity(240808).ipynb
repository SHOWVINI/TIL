  Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .\\n45

                     The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

                                      This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72

and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                            It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

staff will hail a cab for you .\\n32                                                  You come to a place like Trip Advisor and it\\u0092s so, so hard to tell fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .\\n33

feeling entitled with your nose up in the air like they owe you something, then I daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff I encountered doesn\\u0092t sound anything like

                                                    , but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .\\n42

wouldn't plan on using it .\\n44

            But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .\\n46

It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good .\\n134

meal in the ground floor restaurant, well cooked again, but the service was very slow .\\n135                                         Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

                                         When I got to the room, I thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but I guess those come later

                        I did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .\\n60

                   Our family of 4 frequents Chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and Navy Pier that Swissotel's

               I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\n101

                                                  We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111

&quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116

                                                                                                                                                                     I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119
